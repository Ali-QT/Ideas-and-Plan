The Project Idea: 

   A person who works on shares speculation want system to keep
the record for his transactions and calculate the Profits 
and return of investment ROI ratio. 

Project Scope
   We will use Python and will store the transactions in
DataBase using SQlight. 

   
   System Tabels: 
       1. Shares_table. [Name] 
       2. Buy_Transactions_table.[buy]
           Date, share_name, amount, price, total cose
       3. Sell_transaction_table[sell] 
           Date, share_name, amount, price, profit 
       4. Budget_table 
           Date, amount, notes  
            (Notes: New budget increases, money withdrawal)
       

    System Functions: 
        For each table, we will have three main functions 
        Add, Edit and Delete.
        
        Also we will write a Menu to access each Function.
