The Project Idea: 

   A person who works on shares speculation want system to keep
the record for his transactions and calculate the Profits 
and return of investment ROI ratio. 

Project Scope
   We will use Python and store the transactions in a
DataBase using SQlight3. 

   
   System Tabels: 
       1. Shares_table. [Name] 
       2. Buy_Transactions_table.[buy]
           Date, share_name, amount, price, total cose
       3. Sell_transaction_table[sell] 
           Date, share_name, amount, price, profit 
       4. Budget_table 
           Date, amount, notes  
            (Notes: New budget increases, money withdrawal)
       

    System Functions: 
        For each table, we will have three main functions 
        Add, Edit and Delete.
        
        Also we will write a Menu to access each Function. 


     The idea is,FIRST the user will create a budget profile, (date,budget amount)
Then each time the use buy or sell  shares, he 
will add a record saving the date, share name, shares amount 
Transactions type, share price. If the Transaction is Buy then
We will debit the total from the budget we have in the system
and if the transaction type is Sell we will add the record
 of date, share nameand, sharea amount selling price and will
Increase the budget.
