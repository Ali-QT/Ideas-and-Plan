# Ideas-and-Plan
I will list down some Functions to write using Python.
Also contains some public data-set that anyone can use.
To read more about my Python functions and code, got to my website: http://ahradwani.com

LEGAL TERM for using the Data-Sets:
              "This data-set created for testing and training purposes only. Anyone can use it under his/her responsibility without any legal obligation for the owner/creator for any missing or wrong data."
